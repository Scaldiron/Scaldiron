- 👋 Hi, I’m @Scaldiron
- 👀 I’m interested in web modernization and creating accessible user-focused applications with a 2020+ feel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning any and all Javascript frameworks. Currently staying on the React side of things. I've tried Angular but I need more experience with it to make a judgement.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects both large and small. I particularly enjoying helping local non-profits with modernizing their web infrastructure. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send an email to swillkeough@gmail.com to get in contact or leave a message on one of my projects. Thanks!
